This project addresses a practical challenge proposed by the [**Unibotics**](https://unibotics.org/) educational robotics framework.

## Follow Line Project Objectives

The primary objective of this exercise is to implement a robust control system for the F1 car, enabling it to autonomously navigate the track by adhering to the red line.

This involves developing a vision-based algorithm capable of completing a full lap. A secondary performance goal is to tune the controller parameters to minimize the lap completion time, ensuring both stability and speed.
